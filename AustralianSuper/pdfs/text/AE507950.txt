annual leave, such Employee shall continue to receive  payment of the shift loading in 
lieu of the 17 .5% leave loading where the shift loading is higher.

SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES 

18.1 

If a dispute relates to: 

(a) 
(b) 

a matter arising under the agreement; or 
the NES; 

this term sets out procedures to settle the dispute. 

18.2 

18.3 

18.4 

An  Employee  who  is  a  party  to  the  dispute  may  appoint  a  representative  for  the 
purposes of the procedures in this term. 

In  the first instance, the parties to the dispute must try to  resolve the dispute at the 
workplace  level,  by  discussions  between  the  Employee  or  Employees  and  relevant 
supervisors and/ or management. 

If discussions at the workplace level do not resolve the dispute, a party to the dispute 
may refer the matter to the FWC. 

18.5 

The  FWC  may deal with the dispute in 2 stages: 

(a) 

(b) 

the  FWC  will  first  attempt to  resolve  the  dispute  as  it considers  appropriate, 
including  by  mediation,  conciliation,  expressing  an  opinion  or  making  a 
recommendation; and 
if the  FWC  is  unable  to  resolve  the  dispute  at the  first  stage,  the  FWC  may 
then: 
(i) 
(ii) 

arbitrate the dispute; and 
make a determination that is  binding on the parties. 

Note: 

If  the  FWC  arbitrates  the  dispute,  it  may  also  use  the  powers  that  are 
available to it under the Act. 

A decision that FWC  makes when  arbitrating a dispute  is  a decision for the purpose 
of  Div  3  of  Part  5.1  of the  Act.  Therefore,  an  appeal  may  be  made  against  the 
decision. 

18.6 

While the parties are trying to resolve the dispute using the procedures in this term: 

(a) 

an  Employee  must  continue  to  perform  their  work  as  they  would  normally 
unless they have  a reasonable  concern  about an  imminent risk to their health 
or safety; and 

36 

360 Personnel Pty Ltd  Enterprise Agreement 2020 - 2024 

(b) 

an  Employee  must comply  with  a  direction  given  by  the  Company  to  perform 
other available work at the same workplace, or at another workplace, unless: 
(i) 
(ii) 

the work is  not safe; or 
applicable  work  health  and  safety legislation  would  not permit the  work 
to be performed; or 
the work is not appropriate for the Employee to perform; or 
there are other reasonable grounds for the Employee to refuse to comply 
with the direction. 

(iii) 
(iv) 

18.7 

18.8 

The  parties  to  the  dispute  agree  to  be  bound  by  a  decision  made  by  the  FWC  in 
accordance with this term. 

In  discharging its role  and  exercising its powers under this procedure, the FWC  must 
not determine an outcome that is inconsistent with the Building Code  2016.
